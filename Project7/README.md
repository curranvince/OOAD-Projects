Project Title: _Soul Keeper_

Team Members: Vince Curran, Logan Park, Kevin Vo

Final Project 7 video walk-through URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNVAAF8Ck4s  
The poor quality and lag in the video is due to it being a recording of an online stream. The performance of the game itself has been super smooth on all our testing machines.  

Language Specification:  
Made with Unity 2020.3 (LTS)  
.NET 4.6 (C# 7.3) compiled with Roslyn

Code:  
All code can be found directly in the /Scripts folder. 

To Play:  
Download the .zip for your system (PC/Mac) from the releases section of /OOAD-Projects  
Extract the zip and run the included .exe/.app

The game is tailored to PC (best performance, no bugs) but available on other platforms:  

Mac Users:  
The game will fail to open initially becuase Apple cannot 'check that theres no malicious content'  
You can go to Security and Privacy to allow the app through anyway  
We promise there is nothing malicious  

Alternate Web Version:  
https://play.unity.com/mg/other/soulkeeper_webgl

Web Version Notes:  
If UI is weird, going fullscreen should fix it  
Due to controls overlapping with common browser shortcuts (such as Ctrl+W), it is not a reccomended experienece  
Can save/load games within a session (unless you have a Unity account it will save to that)  
Quit button freezes app (not webpage) so instead of using quit, you can just close the tab its open in to quit
