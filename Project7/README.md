Web Version Notes:  
If UI is weird, going fullscreen should fix it  
Due to controls overlapping with common browser shortcuts (such as Ctrl+W), it is not a reccomended experienece  
Can save/load games within a session (unless you have a Unity account it will save to that)  
Quit button freezes app (not webpage) so instead of using quit, you can just close the tab its open in to quit
