Program to simulate running a music store for 30 days.
Java Version 8

Sample output in src/Output.txt

To run:
Navigate to src folder in terminal.
Type 'make run'
Output will be in file 'Output.txt'

Clean with 'make clean'

Alternatively, using the 'Run' feature of a Java-supported IDE while in the App.java file should make the program run.

Assumptions:
- Keep showing items to the customer if we have more of the type they want and they decide not to buy. Theres a switch in the code to make it so only one is shown its commented.
- If we don't have enough money to buy a customers item, broadcast that and let the customer leave.
