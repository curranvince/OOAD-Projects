Program to simulate running a music store for 30 days.

Sample output in src/Output.txt

To run:
Navigate to src folder in terminal.
Type 'make run'
Output will be in file 'Output.txt'

Clean with 'make clean'

Alternatively, using the 'Run' feature of a Java-supported IDE while in the App.java file should make the program run.

Assumptions:
 We assume we keep showing items to the customer if we have more fo the type they want and they decide not to buy. Theres a switch in the code to make it so only one is shown its commented.
